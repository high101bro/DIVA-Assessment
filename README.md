# DIVA-Assessment
DIVA (Damn Insecure and Vulnerable Application) Assessment 

![image](https://github.com/high101bro/DIVA-Assessment/assets/13679268/a6d47a52-ac5b-4697-91b3-c6c15ae5266b)

**DIVA (Damn Insecure and Vulnerable Application)** for Android is an intentionally insecure mobile application designed for the educational purpose of teaching Android application security. The app contains various vulnerabilities that are commonly found in Android applications, making it a useful tool for security professionals, developers, and students to practice their skills in a controlled environment.

DIVA allows users to learn about and test a range of security issues such as SQL injection, insecure data storage, insecure logging, vulnerabilities within the Android platform itself, and problems arising from misconfigured app components. Each section of the app is designed to demonstrate a specific vulnerability, allowing users to exploit it in order to understand how it works and why it is a risk.

By practicing with DIVA, individuals can improve their ability to identify security weaknesses in Android applications, learn how to exploit these vulnerabilities, and gain experience in applying appropriate security measures to protect mobile applications.

The source code for DIVA Android can be found [here](https://github.com/payatu/diva-android) on GitHub by payatu. The original compiled DIVA apk can be found [here](https://github.com/0xArab/diva-apk-file) on Github by 0xArab, but for completeness, I've I've included a copy in this repo.

Here I'll be detailing my process as I assess all thirteen (13) vulnerabilities availabe within DIVA.

## Environment Configuration and Setup
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My environment consists of a laptop running Windows 11, with Kali running with WSL - I'm using Win-Kex to view Kali's desktop. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw9IayBhBJEiwAVuc3fqQoq4Q52otj5C432gWKB5goRUia9s-Jcw5vJs5J_g7d68-yjKlklBoCUZQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) was installed within Kali, rather than within the host Windows environment. A Pixel 3a XL API 25 2 emulator was downloaded and configured within Android Studio and the DIVA apk was installed by being pushed to it via adb (Android Debug Bridge).

## Insecure Logging
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**Insecure logging** refers to the practice of storing sensitive or confidential information in log files without adequate protection. Insecure logging can lead to serious security risks if these log files are accessed by unauthorized users, potentially exposing sensitive data and compromising user privacy. It's essential for developers to implement proper logging mechanisms, including encryption and access controls, to ensure the security of log files and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Common examples include:
- Logging sensitive data: Developers may inadvertently include sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII) in log messages.
- Logging without encryption: Logging mechanisms may not encrypt the data before writing it to log files, making it vulnerable to interception if accessed by unauthorized parties.
- Failure to restrict access: Log files may be accessible to other applications or users on the device, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Logging in release builds: Developers sometimes forget to disable or remove logging statements in release builds of their applications, potentially exposing sensitive data to users or attackers.

### Assessment ###

Within Kali, I decompileed the APK with jadx-gui.

![image](https://github.com/high101bro/DIVA-Assessment/assets/13679268/cfb2f8d0-35e1-457c-a790-c49dbb34b482)

The jadx-gui appears, and I selected the DivaApplication.apk file. Navigating down through the tree you'll find the vulnerable code associated with "LogActivity".

![image](https://github.com/high101bro/DIVA-Assessment/assets/13679268/a1d308a8-e808-4dc8-9e56-d002ad7fb770)

The vulnerability in this code lies in the insecure logging of credit card information. Specifically, in the `catch` block, the credit card information entered by the user (`cctxt.getText().toString()`) is directly logged to the Android system log using:
```java
Log.e("diva-log", "Error while processing transaction with credit card: " + cctxt.getText().toString())`
```

This poses a significant security risk because sensitive information, such as credit card details, should never be logged in plaintext due to the potential for unauthorized access. If an attacker gains access to the device or the log files, they could easily retrieve the credit card information and misuse it.

To address this vulnerability, developers should avoid logging sensitive information, especially in plaintext. Instead, they should implement secure logging practices such as:

- Logging only necessary information for debugging purposes.
- Ensuring that sensitive data is properly obfuscated or encrypted before being logged.
- Using logging frameworks that support secure logging features, such as log redaction or masking of sensitive information.

By following these practices, developers can prevent the exposure of sensitive information and enhance the security of their applications.

### Proof of Concept ###

For "realism" I looked up 100% fake credit card numbers to test with from [BlueSnap Developers]

I navigated to "1. Insecure Logging" and entered the fake credit card number.

Using **adb logcat**, you can view the Android logs.

Note that you see the fake credit card information logged!

## Hardcoding Issues - Part 1
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

**Hardcoding Issues** in Android applications refer to the practice of embedding sensitive information directly into the source code or resources of the application. This presents a significant security risk because anyone with access to the application's code can easily extract these hardcoded values, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive data.

Common examples of hardcoded issues in applications include:
- API Keys: Embedding API keys directly into the source code makes them vulnerable to extraction by decompiling the application, exposing them to potential misuse or abuse.
- Passwords and Credentials: Storing passwords or other sensitive credentials directly in the code or resources can lead to security breaches if the application is compromised.
- URLs and Endpoints: Hardcoding URLs or endpoints for API calls without proper encryption or obfuscation can expose the backend infrastructure to potential attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or unauthorized access.

### Assessment ###

In the jadx-gui, reference [here](#insecure-logging) on how to launch it, you can see the vulnerable code associated with "HardcodeActivity".

![image](https://github.com/high101bro/DIVA-Assessment/assets/13679268/2a1ee036-7c94-4619-9bb4-d5cc09955b68)

The vulnerability in this code lies in the hardcoding of the secret key directly within the application code. Specifically, the secret key "vendorsecretkey" is hardcoded in the `if` statement:

```java
if (hckey.getText().toString().equals("vendorsecretkey")) {
```

This means that anyone who decompiles the application or inspects the source code can easily identify the secret key. Consequently, an attacker could extract the key and gain unauthorized access to the application's sensitive functionality or data.

To address this vulnerability, developers should avoid hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys directly into the application code. Instead, they should use secure storage mechanisms or external configuration files to store such sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to potential attackers.
